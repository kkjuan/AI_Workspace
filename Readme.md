## AI Projects

- **[Linear Regression Analysis](https://kkjuan.github.io/WebSim_LR_demo/):** An interactive tool for performing regression analysis. Adjust the parameters on the left to observe how they impact the regression line.
- **[Iris Dataset Visualization and Accuracy Table](https://kkjuan.github.io/AI_Workspace/Iris_Visualization/iris_visualization_and_accuracy.html):** A visualization and classification analysis of the Iris dataset.
- **[Django Blog Project](https://github.com/kkjuan/django_blog):** A blog project built with Django to practice its structure and implementation.
- **[PTT Crawling Project](https://github.com/kkjuan/ptt):** A web crawling application designed to extract information from PTT, a popular Taiwanese online forum.
- **[Reinforcement Learning game: Pathfinding game](https://kkjuan.github.io/Reinforcement-learning-game/):** A grid game as to choose a grid size of 5x5, 7x7, or 10x10, then click the "Create Game Board" button to generate a new game board. Click "Start Learning" to let the AI begin finding the optimal path. Watch as the AI uses reinforcement learning to navigate from the start point (green) to the goal (red). Once learning is complete, the optimal path will be highlighted in yellow. Explore the power of reinforcement learning by playing the game today!

## Previous Work Projects

- **[Machine Security Enhancement](https://github.com/kkjuan/Machinekey-for-php):** Developed a machine key extraction function for ADAS AVM (Around View Monitoring) products. This function is crucial during the boot-up stage, where a machine key provided by the manufacturer is required. If the key is lost, users typically need to request it again from the manufacturer, which is inconvenient. To improve user experience, I created a [web-based solution](https://github.com/kkjuan/Machinekey-for-php) that allows users to easily retrieve the machine key.
